"""
Job Recommendation Model Training Script

This module will contain the training logic for the job recommendation ML model.
Currently a placeholder for future implementation.

In production, this will:
- Load user and job data
- Train a collaborative filtering or content-based recommendation model
- Save the trained model to saved_models/ directory

    Train the job recommendation ML model.
    
    This function will:
    1. Load historical user-job interaction data
    2. Preprocess features
    3. Train recommendation model (e.g., collaborative filtering, neural network)
    4. Evaluate model performance
    5. Save model to saved_models/recommender.pkl
