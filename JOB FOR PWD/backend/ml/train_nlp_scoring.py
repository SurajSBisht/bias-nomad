"""
NLP-based Job Scoring Model Training Script

This module will contain the training logic for NLP-based job scoring.
Currently a placeholder for future implementation.

In production, this will:
- Use NLP to analyze job descriptions and user profiles
- Score jobs based on accessibility, inclusivity, and match quality
- Save the trained model to saved_models/ directory

    Train the NLP-based job scoring model.
    
    This function will:
    1. Load job descriptions and user profiles
    2. Extract features using NLP (e.g., BERT, spaCy)
    3. Train scoring model to predict job-user match quality
    4. Evaluate model performance
    5. Save model to saved_models/nlp_scorer.pkl
